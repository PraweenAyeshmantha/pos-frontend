# Orders Menu APIs Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Orders Menu APIs as specified in the issue "Orders Menu - Develop required APIs". The implementation provides comprehensive functionality for managing orders in the POS system.

## Issue Requirements

Based on the UI screenshots and issue description, cashiers need to:
- Verify order information (online and offline)
- Save orders in the orders menu
- Create receipts/invoices for orders
- Hold orders for later processing
- Re-add held orders to the cart
- Transfer orders to the kitchen (for restaurant/cafe outlets)
- Remove held orders
- Process returns and refunds

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

#### OrderItemDTO
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/OrderItemDTO.java`

Represents individual order items with comprehensive details:
- Product information (ID, name)
- Quantity and pricing
- Tax calculations
- Discount information
- Custom item flags

#### OrderDetailDTO
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/OrderDetailDTO.java`

Extends order information to include:
- All fields from OrderDTO
- Complete order items list
- Table information (for dine-in orders)

### 2. New Service Methods

**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/service/OrderService.java`

Added the following methods:

1. **getOrderDetailsById(Long orderId)**
   - Returns OrderDetailDTO with complete order and items information
   - Used for displaying order details in the UI

2. **restoreOrderToCart(Long orderId)**
   - Restores an ON_HOLD order back to DRAFT status
   - Allows cashiers to re-edit held orders
   - Validates that only ON_HOLD orders can be restored

3. **transferToKitchen(Long orderId)**
   - Changes order status from ON_HOLD or DRAFT to PREPARING
   - Used for restaurant/cafe outlets to send orders to kitchen
   - Validates order status before transfer

4. **deleteOrder(Long orderId)**
   - Deletes non-completed orders
   - Prevents deletion of completed orders to maintain transaction history
   - Used for removing unwanted held orders

### 3. New API Endpoints

**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/controller/OrderController.java`

#### GET /api/admin/orders/{id}/details
- Retrieves detailed order information including all items
- Returns OrderDetailDTO
- Used for displaying complete order information in UI

#### POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/restore
- Restores a held order back to the cart
- Changes status from ON_HOLD to DRAFT
- Allows modifications before final processing

#### POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/transfer-to-kitchen
- Transfers order to kitchen for preparation
- Changes status to PREPARING
- Used in restaurant/cafe mode

#### DELETE /api/admin/orders/{id}
- Deletes an order
- Only works for non-completed orders
- Used to remove unwanted held orders

### 4. Existing Endpoints Enhanced

The following endpoints were already implemented and support the Orders Menu requirements:

- **GET /api/admin/orders** - List all orders with filtering
- **GET /api/admin/orders/{id}** - Get single order
- **POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/hold** - Put order on hold
- **POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/cancel** - Cancel order
- **POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/refund** - Refund order

## Testing

### Unit Tests

#### OrderServiceNewApisTest
**File:** `src/test/java/com/pos/service/OrderServiceNewApisTest.java`

9 comprehensive tests covering:
- Order details retrieval with items
- Restore order to cart functionality
- Transfer to kitchen workflow
- Delete order validation
- Error handling for invalid states

#### OrderControllerNewApisTest
**File:** `src/test/java/com/pos/controller/OrderControllerNewApisTest.java`

4 controller tests covering:
- HTTP endpoint responses
- Request/response mapping
- Error handling
- Status code validation

### Test Results
- **Total Tests:** 200
- **Passed:** 200
- **Failed:** 0
- **Skipped:** 0

All tests pass successfully, including the new tests and all existing tests.

## Documentation

## UI Integration Points

Based on the UI screenshots, the implementation supports:

### Order List View
- Filter by Online/Offline status (`isOnline` field)
- Filter by Hold status (use `status=ON_HOLD`)
- Display customer information (name, email, phone)
- Show order totals and status
- Display order number and date

### Order Details View
- Complete order information with items
- Item details (name, quantity, price)
- Subtotal, tax, discount breakdown
- Customer and outlet information
- Print invoice capability (data provided via API)

### Order Actions
1. **Hold Orders**
   - Use: `POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/hold`
   - Changes status to ON_HOLD

2. **Restore to Cart**
   - Use: `POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/restore`
   - Changes status back to DRAFT for editing

3. **Transfer to Kitchen**
   - Use: `POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/transfer-to-kitchen`
   - Changes status to PREPARING

4. **Remove/Delete**
   - Use: `DELETE /api/admin/orders/{id}`
   - Permanently deletes the order

5. **Refund**
   - Use: `POST /api/admin/orders/{id}/refund`
   - Changes status to REFUNDED

## Benefits

1. **Complete Order Management**
   - Full CRUD operations for orders
   - State transition management
   - Comprehensive order details with items

2. **Flexible Workflow Support**
   - Support for both retail and restaurant/cafe modes
   - Hold and restore functionality
   - Kitchen integration for food service

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Validation of state transitions
   - Prevention of invalid operations
   - Completed orders cannot be deleted

4. **Rich Data Structure**

   - Clear error messages

## Technical Highlights

### Clean Architecture
- DTOs separate domain from API layer
- Service layer handles business logic
- Controller layer handles HTTP concerns
- Repository layer handles data persistence

### Type Safety
- Enums for order status and type
- Strongly typed DTOs
- BigDecimal for financial calculations

### Error Handling
- Descriptive error messages
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Validation of business rules
- Resource not found exceptions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for service layer
- Controller tests for endpoints
- Mock-based testing approach
- High test coverage

## Migration Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing endpoints remain unchanged
- New DTOs extend existing patterns
- No database schema changes required

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Partial Refunds**
   - Support refunding specific items
   - Calculate partial refund amounts
   - Track refund history

2. **Order Modifications**
   - Add/remove items from existing orders

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Date range queries
   - Customer-based filtering
   - Amount range filters
   - Payment method filters

5. **Order Analytics**
