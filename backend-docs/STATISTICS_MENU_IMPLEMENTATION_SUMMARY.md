# Statistics Menu Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the implementation of the Statistics Menu feature for the POS backend system. The feature allows cashiers to view daily sales reports including opening cash drawer amount, cash sales, total sales, and expected drawer amount.

## Feature Requirements

Based on the issue requirements, the Statistics Menu should provide:

1. **Open Cash Drawer Amount** - The opening balance from the start of the day
2. **Today's Cash Sale** - Total cash sales for the day
3. **Today's Total Sale** - Total sales (all payment methods) for the day
4. **Expected Drawer Amount** - Calculated as: opening balance + cash sales + cash in - cash out

Additionally, the menu displays:
- List of daily produced transactions (available via existing Transaction API)
- Ability to create manual transactions for incoming/outgoing cash reports (available via existing Transaction API)

## Implementation

### 1. Data Transfer Object (DTO)

**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/DailySalesReportDTO.java`

Created a new DTO to represent the daily sales report with the following fields:
- `openCashDrawerAmount`: Opening balance from OPENING_BALANCE transactions
- `todaysCashSale`: Total cash sales from completed orders
- `todaysTotalSale`: Total sales (all payment methods) from completed orders
- `expectedDrawerAmount`: Calculated expected cash drawer amount

### 2. Service Layer

**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/service/StatisticsService.java`

Implemented `StatisticsService` with the following key method:
- `calculateDailySalesReport(Long outletId, LocalDate date)`: Calculates daily sales statistics

**Calculation Logic:**

1. **Opening Balance**: Sum of all OPENING_BALANCE transactions for the outlet and date
2. **Today's Cash Sale**: Sum of payments from completed orders where payment method slug = "cash"
3. **Today's Total Sale**: Sum of total amounts from all completed orders
4. **Expected Drawer Amount**: 
   ```
   Opening Balance + Cash Sales + Cash In - Cash Out - Expenses
   ```

### 3. Controller Layer

**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/controller/StatisticsController.java`

Created `StatisticsController` with endpoint:
- `GET /api/statistics/daily-sales-report`
  - Parameters:
    - `outletId` (required): The outlet ID
    - `date` (optional): The date to get the report for (defaults to today)

### 4. Testing

**Files:**
- `src/test/java/com/pos/service/StatisticsServiceTest.java`
- `src/test/java/com/pos/controller/StatisticsControllerTest.java`

Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Daily sales report with all data types
- Reports with no transactions
- Reports with only cash sales
- Reports with mixed payment methods
- Default date handling

**Test Results:** All 8 tests passing ✓

## API Endpoint

### GET /api/statistics/daily-sales-report

**Request:**
```bash
GET /api/statistics/daily-sales-report?outletId=1&date=2025-10-15
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "code": "success",
  "message": "Daily sales report retrieved successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T16:00:00Z",
  "path": "/api/statistics/daily-sales-report",
  "data": {
    "openCashDrawerAmount": 1000.00,
    "todaysCashSale": 803.50,
    "todaysTotalSale": 2303.38,
    "expectedDrawerAmount": 1803.50
  }
}
```

## UI Integration

The Statistics Menu UI should make the following API calls:

1. **Daily Sales Report**: `GET /api/statistics/daily-sales-report?outletId={id}`
   - Display the four metric cards using the response data
   
2. **Today's Transactions List**: `GET /api/admin/transactions?outletId={id}&startDate={today}&endDate={today}`
   - Display the transaction list table
   
3. **Create Manual Transaction**: `POST /api/admin/transactions`
   - For creating incoming/outgoing cash reports

## Dependencies

The implementation uses existing repositories:
- `TransactionRepository`: For retrieving transaction data
- `OrderRepository`: For retrieving order data
- `PaymentRepository`: For payment data (indirectly via Order entity)

No new database schema changes required.

## Documentation

- **API Documentation**: `STATISTICS_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Test Script**: `test-statistics-api.sh`

## Testing the API

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   ./test-statistics-api.sh
   ```

3. Or manually test using curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/statistics/daily-sales-report?outletId=1" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Tenant-ID: tenant1"
   ```

## Files Changed/Added

### New Files
1. `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/DailySalesReportDTO.java` - DTO for daily sales report
2. `src/main/java/com/pos/service/StatisticsService.java` - Service for calculating statistics
3. `src/main/java/com/pos/controller/StatisticsController.java` - REST controller for statistics endpoints
4. `src/test/java/com/pos/service/StatisticsServiceTest.java` - Service unit tests
5. `src/test/java/com/pos/controller/StatisticsControllerTest.java` - Controller unit tests
6. `STATISTICS_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - API documentation
7. `STATISTICS_MENU_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file
8. `test-statistics-api.sh` - Test script

### Modified Files
None - This is a pure addition to the codebase with no modifications to existing code.

## Backward Compatibility

✓ No breaking changes
✓ All existing tests continue to pass
✓ No database schema changes required
✓ No modifications to existing APIs

## Notes

- All monetary values are handled as `BigDecimal` for precision
- Dates use `LocalDate` for simplicity (date without time)
- Date-time conversions use system default timezone
- Only completed orders are included in sales calculations
- Cash sales specifically refer to payments made with payment method slug "cash"
- Both CASH_OUT and EXPENSE transaction types are deducted from expected drawer amount

## Next Steps

For frontend integration:
1. Create Statistics Menu component
2. Integrate with the daily sales report API
3. Display the four metric cards
4. Add transaction list table using existing Transaction API
5. Add manual transaction creation form using existing Transaction API
