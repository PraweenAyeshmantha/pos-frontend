# Password Reset Loop Fix

## Problem
Users were experiencing an infinite loop when resetting their password:
1. User resets password successfully
2. System asks them to login
3. After login, system asks to reset password again
4. This continues indefinitely

## Root Cause
After a successful password reset, the application was:
1. Calling `logout()` which cleared all authentication data
2. Redirecting to the login page
3. Upon re-login, the backend might return stale data with `requirePasswordReset: true`
4. OR the frontend wasn't properly updating the `requirePasswordReset` flag
5. This triggered another redirect to the password reset page, creating a loop

## Solution
The fix involves three key changes:

### 1. Navigate to Dashboard After Reset (ResetPasswordPage.tsx)
**Before:**
```typescript
await resetPassword(currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword);
logout(); // This clears all auth data!
navigate('/login', { replace: true, state: { passwordResetSuccess: true } });
```

**After:**
```typescript
await resetPassword(currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword);
// Password reset successful - navigate to dashboard
// The user already has a valid token after successful reset
navigate('/admin/dashboard', { replace: true });
```

**Rationale:** After a successful password reset, the backend returns a new valid JWT token. There's no need to logout and re-authenticate. The user should be able to continue their session with the new password.

### 2. Explicitly Set requirePasswordReset to False (authService.ts & AuthContext.tsx)
**Before:**
```typescript
requirePasswordReset: response.data.data.requirePasswordReset, // Trust backend response
```

**After:**
```typescript
requirePasswordReset: false, // Explicitly set to false after successful reset
```

**Rationale:** This provides a defensive measure against potential backend issues. If the backend returns stale data or has a bug where it doesn't update the flag, the frontend will still work correctly. A successful password reset should always result in `requirePasswordReset: false`.

### 3. Removed passwordResetCompleted Flag
**Before:**
- Set `localStorage.setItem('passwordResetCompleted', 'true')` after reset
- Check this flag in ProtectedRoute to avoid redirect loops
- Clear this flag on logout

**After:**
- Removed the flag entirely
- Rely on the `requirePasswordReset` property in the user object

**Rationale:** The `passwordResetCompleted` flag was a workaround that added unnecessary complexity. By explicitly setting `requirePasswordReset: false` after a successful reset, we don't need an additional flag.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Initial Login with Password Reset Required:**
   - Login with a user account that has `requirePasswordReset: true`
   - Should be redirected to `/reset-password` page
   
2. **Reset Password:**
   - Enter current password
   - Enter new password (minimum 4 characters)
   - Confirm new password
   - Submit the form
   - **Expected:** Redirected to `/admin/dashboard` (not login page)
   - **Expected:** Can navigate to other pages without being redirected to reset password
   
3. **Logout and Re-login:**
   - Logout from the system
   - Login again with the new password
   - **Expected:** Successfully login and access dashboard
   - **Expected:** NOT redirected to password reset page
   
4. **Session Persistence:**
   - After password reset, refresh the page
   - **Expected:** Still authenticated, not redirected to login or reset password

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ After password reset, user stays authenticated
- ✅ User is redirected to dashboard, not login page
- ✅ `requirePasswordReset` is set to `false` after successful reset
- ✅ User can access all protected routes after reset
- ✅ Logging out and logging in again works normally
- ✅ No infinite redirect loop

## Files Changed
1. `src/pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Removed logout, navigate to dashboard
2. `src/services/authService.ts` - Explicitly set `requirePasswordReset: false`, removed flag
3. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Explicitly set `requirePasswordReset: false`
4. `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Removed `passwordResetCompleted` check

## Backward Compatibility
This fix is fully backward compatible:
- Existing users with `requirePasswordReset: false` are unaffected
- Users with `requirePasswordReset: true` will get the correct behavior
- The backend API contract remains unchanged
- No database migrations or backend changes required

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Backend returns stale data:** Frontend overrides with `requirePasswordReset: false`
2. **Network errors during reset:** Error is displayed, user stays on reset page
3. **Invalid password:** Error is displayed, user can retry
4. **User navigates back after reset:** Protected route allows access since flag is false
5. **Multiple password resets in one session:** Each reset properly updates the flag

## Security Considerations
- JWT token is properly updated after password reset
- Old token is replaced with new token from backend
- User stays authenticated with valid credentials
- No security degradation from the previous implementation

## Future Improvements
Consider these enhancements:
1. Add a success message on dashboard after password reset
2. Show password strength indicator during reset
3. Add password history to prevent reusing old passwords
4. Implement token refresh mechanism for long sessions
5. Add unit tests for the authentication flow
