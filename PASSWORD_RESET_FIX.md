# Password Reset Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the correct implementation of the password reset flow in the POS frontend application.

## Requirements
Based on the problem statement and backend API documentation:
1. If `requirePasswordReset: false` → user can access the system normally
2. If `requirePasswordReset: true` → user must reset password before accessing protected routes
3. **After password reset → user MUST logout and login again with new password to authenticate**

## Implementation
The password reset flow is implemented to ensure users authenticate with their new password after a successful reset.

### Key Behaviors

#### 1. Logout After Password Reset (ResetPasswordPage.tsx)
```typescript
await resetPassword(currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword);
// Password reset successful - logout and redirect to login
// User needs to login again with new password to authenticate
logout();
navigate('/login', { replace: true, state: { passwordResetSuccess: true } });
```

**Rationale:** After a successful password reset, the user must logout and login again with their new password. This ensures proper authentication and follows the backend's guidance message: "Please login with your new password."

#### 2. Don't Update State After Password Reset (authService.ts & AuthContext.tsx)
**authService.ts:**
```typescript
async resetPassword(resetData: ResetPasswordRequest): Promise<ResetPasswordResponse> {
  const response = await apiClient.post<ResetPasswordResponse>('/auth/reset-password', resetData);
  
  // Don't update localStorage here - user will be logged out after password reset
  // and need to login again with new password
  
  return response.data;
}
```

**AuthContext.tsx:**
```typescript
const resetPassword = async (currentPassword: string, newPassword: string, confirmPassword: string) => {
  if (!authState.user) {
    throw new Error('No user logged in');
  }
  
  await authService.resetPassword({
    username: authState.user.username,
    currentPassword,
    newPassword,
    confirmPassword,
  });
  
  // Don't update auth state here - caller will handle logout
  // User needs to login again with new password after reset
};
```

**Rationale:** Since the user will be logged out immediately after password reset, there's no need to update localStorage or auth state. The logout function will clear all data, and the user will need to login again with their new password.

#### 3. Trust Backend Response During Login
```typescript
// Login stores requirePasswordReset from backend response
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
  cashierId: response.data.data.cashierId,
  username: response.data.data.username,
  name: response.data.data.name,
  email: response.data.data.email,
  requirePasswordReset: response.data.data.requirePasswordReset, // Use backend value
}));
```

**Rationale:** During login, we trust the backend's `requirePasswordReset` value. If it's `true`, the user will be redirected to reset password page. If it's `false` (after successful reset and re-login), the user can access protected routes normally.

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Initial Login with Password Reset Required:**
   - Login with a user account that has `requirePasswordReset: true`
   - **Expected:** Redirected to `/reset-password` page
   
2. **Reset Password:**
   - Enter current password
   - Enter new password (minimum 4 characters)
   - Confirm new password
   - Submit the form
   - **Expected:** Logged out and redirected to `/login` with success message
   - **Expected:** See message "Password reset successful! Please login with your new password."
   
3. **Re-login with New Password:**
   - Enter username
   - Enter NEW password
   - Submit login form
   - Backend returns `requirePasswordReset: false`
   - **Expected:** Successfully login and redirected to dashboard
   - **Expected:** Can access all protected routes normally
   
4. **Verify No Loop:**
   - Logout from the system
   - Login again with the new password
   - **Expected:** Successfully login and access dashboard
   - **Expected:** NOT redirected to password reset page

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ After password reset, user is logged out
- ✅ User is redirected to login page with success message
- ✅ User must login again with new password
- ✅ Backend returns `requirePasswordReset: false` after successful reset
- ✅ User can access all protected routes after re-login
- ✅ No infinite redirect loop
- ✅ Proper authentication flow maintained

## Files Changed
1. `src/pages/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` - Added logout call, redirect to login after reset
2. `src/services/authService.ts` - Removed localStorage updates after password reset
3. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Removed state updates after password reset
4. `src/services/apiClient.ts` - Removed unused `passwordResetCompleted` flag references

## Backward Compatibility
This fix is fully backward compatible:
- Existing users with `requirePasswordReset: false` are unaffected
- Users with `requirePasswordReset: true` will get the correct behavior
- The backend API contract remains unchanged
- No database migrations or backend changes required

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Network errors during reset:** Error is displayed, user stays on reset page
2. **Invalid password:** Error is displayed, user can retry
3. **User tries to access protected routes before reset:** Redirected to reset password page
4. **423 error from backend:** Checked against user's `requirePasswordReset` flag, redirected appropriately
5. **401 error from backend:** Auth data cleared, redirected to login

## Security Considerations
- User must re-authenticate with new password after reset
- All auth data is cleared on logout after password reset
- New JWT token is obtained during re-login
- Prevents session hijacking with old credentials
- Follows security best practice of re-authentication after password change

## Future Improvements
Consider these enhancements:
1. Show password strength indicator during reset
2. Add password history to prevent reusing old passwords (backend feature)
3. Implement token refresh mechanism for long sessions
4. Add unit tests for the authentication flow
5. Add end-to-end tests for the complete password reset flow
