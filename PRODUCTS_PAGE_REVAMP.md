### 3. Styling Changes

- Updated color scheme to match wireframe (blue links, green/red/yellow status colors)
- Modified spacing and padding for denser information display
- Updated button styles to match wireframe design
- Implemented hover effects for better UX

### 4. Backend Compatibility

All changes are compatible with the existing backend API structure as documented in `docs/backend/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`:
- Product creation endpoint: `POST /api/admin/products`
- Product retrieval: `GET /api/admin/products`
- Product update: `PUT /api/admin/products/{id}`
- Product deletion: `DELETE /api/admin/products/{id}`

The backend supports all the new fields added to the Product type.

### 5. Testing

- ✅ Build passes without errors
- ✅ Linting passes (no errors, only pre-existing warnings in unrelated files)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ CodeQL security scan - no vulnerabilities found
- ✅ UI renders correctly with all features visible
- ✅ All interactive elements properly wired
