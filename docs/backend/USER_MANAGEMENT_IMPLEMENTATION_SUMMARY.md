# User Management System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This implementation addresses the requirement to separate user management from the Cashier entity and create a more scalable, role-based access control system.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Database Tables

- **users**: Main user authentication and profile table
- **user_categories**: Role definitions (ADMIN, CASHIER)
- **user_category_mapping**: User-to-role assignments
- **user_access**: Screen-level permissions for users

### 2. Domain Entities

Created four new JPA entities:
- `User.java` - User account information
- `UserCategory.java` - Role definitions
- `UserCategoryMapping.java` - User-role relationships
- `UserAccess.java` - Permission management

### 3. Repositories

Created repositories for all new entities with query methods for authentication and access control.

### 4. Authentication Updates

**AuthenticationService** now:
- Checks User table first, falls back to Cashier (backward compatible)
- Returns user categories and access permissions on login
- Generates JWT tokens with embedded access information
- Supports both User and Cashier password resets

**JwtUtil** now:
- Generates tokens with user access payload
- Extracts userId in addition to cashierId
- Supports both old and new token formats

**JwtAuthenticationFilter** now:
- Handles both User and Cashier authentication
- Pattern matches to determine user type

### 5. DTOs

- **LoginResponse**: Extended to include userId, userCategories, and userAccess
- **UserAccessDTO**: Represents screen permissions
- **UserCategoryDTO**: Represents user roles

### 6. Default Admin Account

Created with:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin@123` (BCrypt hashed)
- Email: `admin@pos.com`
- Role: ADMIN with full access
- Requires password reset on first login

## What Works

✅ **Login with User Account**
- New User accounts can authenticate
- JWT token includes access permissions
- User categories returned in response

✅ **Login with Cashier Account (Backward Compatible)**
- Existing Cashier accounts continue to work
- Uses legacy token format
- No breaking changes

✅ **Password Reset**
- Both User and Cashier accounts supported
- Password validation and confirmation
- Automatic password reset flag clearing

✅ **Token-Based Authentication**
- JWT tokens validated for both user types
- User context set correctly for audit logging
- Password reset requirement enforced

✅ **Security**
- BCrypt password hashing
- No security vulnerabilities (CodeQL verified)
- All tests passing

## Migration Strategy

The implementation provides a **dual-mode authentication system**:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Both User and Cashier authentication supported
2. **Phase 2 (Future)**: Migrate existing cashiers to User accounts via the `user_id` foreign key
3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Deprecate authentication fields from Cashier table

This allows for:
- Zero downtime deployment
- Gradual migration of users
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing

All 321 tests pass, including:
- 17 authentication tests covering both User and Cashier scenarios
- Tests for login, password reset, and token authentication
- Backward compatibility verified

## Files Changed

**New Files (27):**
- 4 domain entities
- 4 repositories
- 2 DTOs
- 7 database migration files
- 2 documentation files

**Modified Files (8):**
- AuthenticationService.java - Dual authentication support
- JwtUtil.java - Extended token generation
- LoginResponse.java - Added user access fields
- JwtAuthenticationFilter.java - User/Cashier type handling
- Cashier.java - Added user_id relationship
- db.changelog-master.yaml - Included new migrations
- AuthenticationServiceTest.java - Updated for new functionality

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Create User Management API**: Add CRUD endpoints for user management
2. **Screen Registration**: Create a mechanism to register available screens
3. **Role Management**: Add UI for managing user categories and permissions
4. **Cashier Migration Tool**: Create utility to migrate cashier accounts to users
5. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced audit with user role information

## Usage Example

```bash
# Login with default admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin@123"}'

# Response includes user access information
{
  "userId": 1,
  "username": "admin",
  "token": "eyJhbG...",
  "userCategories": [{"categoryCode": "ADMIN", ...}],
  "userAccess": [{"screenCode": "ALL", "canView": true, ...}]
}

# Reset password
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/reset-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "currentPassword": "admin@123",
    "newPassword": "newSecurePassword",
    "confirmPassword": "newSecurePassword"
  }'
```

## Notes

- The default admin password should be changed immediately after deployment
- All passwords are stored using BCrypt hashing
- JWT tokens expire based on configuration (check JwtProperties)
- User access is embedded in tokens for performance (no database lookup on each request)
