# Weight-Based Pricing Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the backend modifications implemented for the Unit/Weight-Based Pricing feature, which allows products to be priced dynamically based on their weight (e.g., fruits, vegetables, meat sold by kg/lb).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File:** `src/main/resources/db/changelog/v1.0/023-add-weight-to-order-items.yaml`

Added a new column `weight` to the `order_items` table:
- **Type:** `DECIMAL(10,3)` - supports up to 9,999,999.999 units
- **Nullable:** Yes (only required for weight-based products)
- **Purpose:** Stores the weight entered by the user for products marked as weight-based

**Master Changelog Updated:** `db.changelog-master.yaml` includes the new migration.

### 2. Entity Changes
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/domain/OrderItem.java`

Added `weight` field to the `OrderItem` entity:
```java
@Column(name = "weight", precision = 10, scale = 3)
private BigDecimal weight;
```

**Note:** The `Product` entity already had the `isWeightBased` field, so no changes were needed there.

### 3. DTO Changes

#### OrderItemDTO
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/OrderItemDTO.java`

Added `weight` field to expose weight information in API responses:
```java
private BigDecimal weight;
```

Updated `fromEntity()` method to include weight mapping.

#### CreateOrderRequest.OrderItemRequest
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/CreateOrderRequest.java`

Added `weight` parameter to the `OrderItemRequest` record:
```java
public record OrderItemRequest(
    Long productId,
    String productName,
    BigDecimal quantity,
    BigDecimal unitPrice,
    BigDecimal discountAmount,
    String notes,
    BigDecimal weight  // New field
) {}
```

#### TableOrderRequest.OrderItemRequest
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/dto/TableOrderRequest.java`

Added `weight` parameter to the `OrderItemRequest` record (same as CreateOrderRequest).

### 4. Service Layer Changes
**File:** `src/main/java/com/pos/service/PosService.java`

#### createOrder() Method
Added weight validation and assignment logic:
```java
// Validate weight-based products
if (product != null && product.getIsWeightBased()) {
    if (itemRequest.weight() == null || itemRequest.weight().compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) <= 0) {
        throw new BadRequestException("error.weight-based-product.weight-required", 
                "Weight is required for weight-based products");
    }
}

// Set weight on order item
orderItem.setWeight(itemRequest.weight());
```

#### createTableOrder() Method
Same validation and assignment logic as `createOrder()`.

### 5. Testing
**File:** `src/test/java/com/pos/service/PosServiceWeightBasedPricingTest.java`

Created comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **testCreateOrder_WithWeightBasedProduct_Success**
   - Tests successful order creation with a weight-based product
   - Verifies weight is stored correctly in the order item

2. **testCreateOrder_WithWeightBasedProduct_MissingWeight_ThrowsException**
   - Tests validation when weight is missing for a weight-based product
   - Verifies the correct error is thrown

3. **testCreateOrder_WithNonWeightBasedProduct_NoWeightRequired_Success**
   - Tests that non-weight-based products don't require weight
   - Verifies weight remains null for regular products

**Test Results:** All 3 tests pass ✅

#### Updated Existing Tests
**File:** `src/test/java/com/pos/controller/PosControllerTest.java`

Updated existing test cases to include the new `weight` parameter (set to `null`) to maintain compatibility.

### 6. Localization
**File:** `src/main/resources/messages.properties`

Added error message for weight validation:
```properties
error.weight-based-product.weight-required=Weight is required for weight-based products. Please enter the weight before adding to cart.
```

### 7. Documentation
**File:** `WEIGHT_BASED_PRICING_API.md`

Created comprehensive API documentation covering:
- Database changes
- Product configuration
- API endpoint changes and examples
- Validation rules
- Frontend implementation guidelines
- Testing scenarios
- Migration information
- Backward compatibility notes

## How It Works

### Backend Flow
1. **Product Configuration:** Products are marked as weight-based by setting `isWeightBased = true` in the database.

2. **Order Creation:**
   - Frontend sends order request with items
   - For weight-based products, the request must include the `weight` field
   - Backend validates: if `isWeightBased = true` and `weight` is null or ≤ 0, throw error
   - Weight is stored in the `order_items.weight` column

3. **Response:**
   - Order item DTOs include the weight field
   - Frontend can display weight information in order details

### Pricing Calculation
The pricing calculation logic is handled by the frontend:
- Frontend calculates: `unitPrice = pricePerUnit × weight`
- Example: If apples are $5/kg and user enters 2.5 kg
  - Frontend sends: `unitPrice = $12.50, quantity = 1, weight = 2.5`
  - Backend stores all three values

## Validation Rules

### Weight-Based Products
- `weight` field is **required**
- `weight` must be > 0
- If missing or ≤ 0, returns error: `error.weight-based-product.weight-required`

### Non-Weight-Based Products
- `weight` field is **optional**
- Can be `null` or omitted
- No validation performed

## API Endpoints Affected

### 1. Create Order
**POST** `/api/pos/orders`

**Request Changes:**
- Added optional `weight` field to each item in the `items` array

**Validation:**
- Weight required for products where `isWeightBased = true`

### 2. Create Table Order
**POST** `/api/pos/tables/{tableId}/orders`

**Request Changes:**
- Added optional `weight` field to each item in the `items` array

**Validation:**
- Weight required for products where `isWeightBased = true`

### 3. All Order Responses
Any endpoint returning orders or order items now includes the `weight` field in the response.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible:**
- Existing products default to `isWeightBased = false`
- Weight field is optional in requests
- Existing orders are not affected
- Frontend apps that don't support weight entry will continue working

## Testing Summary

### Unit Tests
- **Total Tests:** 227
- **Passed:** 227 ✅
- **Failed:** 0
- **Skipped:** 0

### New Tests Added
- 3 new tests for weight-based pricing feature
- All tests passing

### Integration Test Status
- PosBackendApplicationTests fails due to missing MySQL database (pre-existing issue, not related to our changes)

## Database Migration

The migration will be automatically applied by Liquibase when the application starts.

**Changeset ID:** `023-add-weight-to-order-items`

**SQL Generated:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE order_items 
ADD COLUMN weight DECIMAL(10,3) COMMENT 'Weight for weight-based products (e.g., kg, lbs)';
```

## Frontend Integration Guidelines

To integrate with the frontend:

1. **Check Product:** When displaying a product, check if `isWeightBased = true`

2. **Show Weight Entry Dialog:** If weight-based, prompt user to enter weight before adding to cart

3. **Calculate Price:** Calculate `unitPrice = product.price × enteredWeight`

4. **Send Request:** Include the `weight` in the order item request

5. **Display:** Show weight information in cart and order history

See `WEIGHT_BASED_PRICING_API.md` for detailed frontend implementation guidelines.
