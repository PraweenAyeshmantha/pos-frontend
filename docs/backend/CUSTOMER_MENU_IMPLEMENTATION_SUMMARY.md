# Customer Menu - Implementation Summary

## Issue Overview

**Issue:** Customers Menu - Develop required APIs

**Requirements:** Cashiers can add, update, and delete customers in the customer menu. To make an order, the cashier must pick a client by searching for them using their name, email, or phone number. Once found, the cashier may click the Set Customer option to select that person for the purchase.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All required APIs are implemented and tested.

- **Implementation:** `DELETE /api/pos/customers/{id}`
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested (Delete icon in UI)

### 5. ✅ Search Customers
- **Requirement:** Search customers by name, email, or phone number
- **Implementation:** `GET /api/pos/customers/search?term={searchTerm}`
- **Status:** ✅ Implemented and tested

### 6. ✅ Set Customer for Order

- **Implementation:** Customer ID is passed to order creation endpoint
- **Status:** ✅ Already integrated with order system

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Status |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| POST | `/api/pos/customers` | Create new customer | ✅ |
| PUT | `/api/pos/customers/{id}` | Update customer | ✅ |
| DELETE | `/api/pos/customers/{id}` | Delete customer (soft) | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/pos/customers/{id}` | Get customer by ID | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/pos/customers` | Get all customers | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/pos/customers?active=true` | Get active customers | ✅ |
| GET | `/api/pos/customers/search?term=` | Search customers | ✅ |

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Field Search
The search API searches across three fields:
- Customer name (case-insensitive, partial match)
- Email address (case-insensitive, partial match)
- Phone number (partial match)

**Example:**
```bash
# Search by name
GET /api/pos/customers/search?term=John

# Search by email
GET /api/pos/customers/search?term=john@example.com

# Search by phone
GET /api/pos/customers/search?term=1234567890
```

### 2. Soft Delete
Delete operations perform a soft delete:
- Sets `isActive = false`
- Customer remains in database
- Excluded from active lists and search results
- Historical order data remains intact

### 3. Active Customer Filtering
The UI can request only active customers:
```bash
GET /api/pos/customers?active=true
```

### 4. Customer Data Fields
Each customer record includes:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - Customer full name (required)
- `email` - Email address (optional)
- `phone` - Phone number (optional)
- `address` - Physical address (optional)
- `taxNumber` - Tax identification number (optional)
- `loyaltyPoints` - Loyalty points balance
- `isActive` - Active status flag
- `createdDate` - Record creation timestamp
- `lastModifiedDate` - Last update timestamp

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- ✅ **13 Controller Tests** - All passing
- ✅ **16 Service Tests** - All passing
- ✅ **Total: 29 Tests** - 100% success rate

### Test Coverage
All test files are located in:
- `src/test/java/com/pos/controller/CustomerControllerTest.java`
- `src/test/java/com/pos/service/CustomerServiceTest.java`

### Manual Testing
A comprehensive test script is provided:
```bash
./test-customer-api.sh
```

This script tests all 7 endpoints with various scenarios including:
- Creating customers
- Updating customer information
- Retrieving customers by ID
- Getting all customers
- Getting active customers only
- Searching by name, email, and phone
- Deleting customers
- Verifying soft delete behavior

## Security

✅ **CodeQL Security Scan:** PASSED - No vulnerabilities detected

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided in:
- `CUSTOMER_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API reference with examples
- `test-customer-api.sh` - Executable test script
- Code comments in Controller and Service classes

## Integration with Orders

Customer selection integrates seamlessly with the order creation flow:

1. Cashier searches for customer using search API
2. Customer list is displayed with "Set Customer" option
3. Selected customer ID is passed to order creation
4. Order is associated with the customer

**Order Creation Example:**
```json
POST /api/pos/orders
{
  "customerId": 1,  // ← Customer ID from selection
  "outletId": 1,
  "cashierId": 1,
  "orderType": "COUNTER",
  "items": [...],
  "payments": [...]
}
```

## Database Schema

Customer table structure (from `AbstractAuditableEntity` base class):
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address VARCHAR(500),
    tax_number VARCHAR(50),
    loyalty_points INT DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_date TIMESTAMP,
    last_modified_date TIMESTAMP,
    created_by VARCHAR(255),
    last_modified_by VARCHAR(255)
);
```

## Multi-Tenancy Support

All endpoints require the `X-Tenant-ID` header for proper multi-tenancy isolation:
```bash
curl -H "X-Tenant-ID: PaPos" http://localhost:8080/posai/api/pos/customers
```

## Response Format

All APIs follow the standardized `ApiResponse` format:
```json
{
  "code": "success",
  "message": "Operation description",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T14:30:00Z",
  "path": "/api/pos/customers",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### What Was Already Implemented
The repository already had a complete implementation of all required Customer APIs:
- `CustomerController` with all CRUD endpoints
- `CustomerService` with business logic
- `CustomerRepository` with search query
- Proper error handling and soft delete
- Integration with order system

### What Was Added
To ensure robustness and documentation:
1. ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (29 tests)
2. ✅ API test script for manual verification
3. ✅ Complete API documentation
4. ✅ Implementation summary document
5. ✅ Security scan verification

### No Code Changes Required
The existing implementation fully meets all requirements. No modifications to the application code were necessary. All work focused on:
- Testing to verify functionality
- Documentation for developers and users
- Test automation for CI/CD

## Usage Examples

### For Frontend Developers

**1. Get customers for display:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/pos/customers?active=true', {
  headers: { 'X-Tenant-ID': 'PaPos' }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  // data.data contains array of active customers
  displayCustomers(data.data);
});
```

**2. Search as user types:**
```javascript
const searchTerm = document.getElementById('search').value;
fetch(`/api/pos/customers/search?term=${searchTerm}`, {
  headers: { 'X-Tenant-ID': 'PaPos' }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  // data.data contains matching customers
  displaySearchResults(data.data);
});
```

**3. Create new customer:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/pos/customers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-Tenant-ID': 'PaPos'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com',
    phone: '1234567890',
    address: '123 Main St',
    isActive: true
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => {
  // data.data contains the created customer with ID
  console.log('Created customer:', data.data);
});
```

**4. Set customer for order:**
```javascript
const customerId = selectedCustomer.id;
// Pass customerId to order creation
createOrder({ customerId, ...otherOrderData });
```
