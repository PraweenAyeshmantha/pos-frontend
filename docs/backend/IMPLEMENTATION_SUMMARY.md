# POS Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) backend system built with Spring Boot, featuring multi-tenant architecture, RESTful APIs, and a complete data model for managing outlets, products, orders, inventory, and customers.

## Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenancy
- **Database-per-tenant** isolation for maximum security
- Tenant identification via `X-Tenant-ID` request header
- Automatic tenant routing at the database connection level
- Independent Liquibase migrations per tenant

### Layered Architecture

## Implemented Features

### 1. Domain Model (14 Entities)

#### Core Entities
- **Outlet**: Store locations with two modes (Grocery/Retail, Restaurant/Cafe)

- **DiningTable**: Tables for restaurant outlets with status tracking
- **Customer**: Customer information with loyalty points
- **Product**: Product catalog with pricing, tax, and categorization
- **Barcode**: Product barcodes (primary and alternative)

#### Transaction Entities
- **Order**: POS orders with multiple types and status workflow
- **OrderItem**: Line items within orders with discount and tax calculation
- **PaymentMethod**: Configurable payment methods with immutable slugs and protected default
- **Payment**: Payment records linked to payment methods
- **Transaction**: Cash drawer transactions (inflows, outflows, expenses)

#### Configuration Entities
- **InvoiceTemplate**: Customizable invoice templates per outlet
- **Configuration**: System settings organized by categories
- **Stock**: Outlet-specific inventory levels with reorder tracking

### 2. Database Schema

Comprehensive Liquibase migrations for all tables:
- Auto-incrementing IDs

- Audit fields (created/modified date and user)
- Optimistic locking (version field)
- Soft delete support (record_status)

### 3. Repository Layer (13 Repositories)

Custom query methods for:
- Finding entities by various criteria
- Searching with LIKE queries
- Date range filtering

## API Endpoints Summary

### Admin APIs (`/api/admin/*`)
- **Outlets**: CRUD + filtering by mode and active status
- **Products**: CRUD + search + category filtering
- **Orders**: CRUD + hold/cancel/refund + date range filtering
- **Payment Methods**: CRUD + slug-based retrieval + protected default deletion + immutable slugs
- **Cashiers**: CRUD + outlet assignments/removal + filtering by outlet
- **Configurations**: CRUD + category-based organization
- **Transactions**: GET with comprehensive filtering
  - Filter by outlet ID (`?outletId=1`)
  - Filter by transaction type (`?transactionType=CASH_IN`)
  - Filter by cashier (`?cashierId=5`)
  - Filter by date range (`?startDate=...&endDate=...`)
  - Supports combined filters (e.g., outlet + type, outlet + date range)

### POS/Cashier APIs (`/api/pos/*`)
- **Customers**: CRUD + search by name/email/phone

### Analytics APIs (`/api/analytics/*`)
- **Sales Analytics**: GET `/sales` - Sales reporting with various metrics (total sales, net sales, orders, average order value, items sold, returns, discounted orders, gross discount, total tax, order tax)
  - Supports filtering by outlet ID (`?outletId=1`)
  - Supports date range filtering (`?startDate=...&endDate=...`)
  - Supports combined outlet and date range filtering

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Database-per-tenant for complete data isolation
- No cross-tenant data leakage possible
- Independent scaling per tenant
- Separate backup and restore per tenant

### 2. Audit Trail
- All entities extend `AbstractAuditableEntity`
- Automatic tracking of created/modified date and user
- Optimistic locking with version field
- Sync timestamp for offline synchronization

### 3. Soft Deletes
- `recordStatus` field marks entities as active/inactive
- Data preserved for historical analysis
- Restore functionality possible

### 4. Flexible Order Management
- Support for multiple order types (Dine-In, Takeaway, Delivery, Counter)
- Comprehensive status workflow
- Multi-payment support
- Hold and refund capabilities

### 5. Inventory Management
- Outlet-specific stock levels
- Reorder level tracking
- Stock adjustment operations
- Low stock alerts

### 6. Configuration System
- Category-based organization (General, Payments, PWA, Login, Printer, Layout)
- Key-value storage with data type support
- Dynamic configuration updates
