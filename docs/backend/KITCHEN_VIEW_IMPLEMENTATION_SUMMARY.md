# Kitchen View Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Kitchen View feature for restaurant/cafe outlets in the POS backend system.

## Feature Description

The Kitchen View is a specialized display for restaurant and cafe outlets that shows orders currently being prepared in the kitchen. Kitchen staff can view order details including customer information, table assignments, and ordered items with images. When an order is ready, staff can click the "Ready" button to mark it as complete and remove it from the kitchen display.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Files Created

#### DTOs
- **`KitchenOrderDTO.java`**: Data transfer object for kitchen order display
  - Contains order metadata (ID, order number, type, created date)
  - Includes customer email for identification
  - Includes table information (ID and number) if applicable
  - Contains nested `KitchenOrderItemDTO` with product name, quantity, and image URL

#### Controllers
- **`KitchenViewController.java`**: REST controller for kitchen view endpoints
  - `GET /api/admin/kitchen/orders?outletId={id}` - Retrieves orders in PREPARING status
  - `POST /api/admin/kitchen/orders/{id}/ready` - Marks an order as READY

#### Tests
- **`OrderServiceKitchenViewTest.java`**: Service layer tests (5 test cases)
  - Tests for getting kitchen orders
  - Tests for marking orders as ready
  - Tests for error scenarios (invalid status, order not found)
  
- **`KitchenViewControllerTest.java`**: Controller layer tests (3 test cases)
  - Tests for HTTP endpoint responses
  - Tests for successful operations
  - Tests for empty results

#### Documentation
- **`KITCHEN_VIEW_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`**: Complete API documentation
  - Endpoint descriptions
  - Request/response formats
  - Error handling
  - Integration notes

- **`test-kitchen-view-api.sh`**: Test script for manual API testing

### 2. Modified Files

#### Services
- **`OrderService.java`**: Added two new methods
  - `getKitchenOrders(Long outletId)`: Retrieves orders in PREPARING status for an outlet
  - `markOrderAsReady(Long orderId)`: Changes order status from PREPARING to READY

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Get Kitchen Orders
```
GET /api/admin/kitchen/orders?outletId={outletId}
```

**Purpose**: Retrieve all orders currently being prepared in the kitchen

**Query Parameters**:
- `outletId` (Long, required): ID of the restaurant/cafe outlet

**Response**: List of `KitchenOrderDTO` objects containing:
- Order identification (ID, number, type)
- Customer email
- Table information (if dine-in)
- List of items with product name, quantity, and image URL

**Status Codes**:
- 200 OK: Orders retrieved successfully
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid parameters
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required

#### Mark Order as Ready
```
POST /api/admin/kitchen/orders/{id}/ready
```

**Purpose**: Mark a prepared order as ready for pickup/serving

**Path Parameters**:
- `id` (Long, required): Order ID

**Response**: Complete `Order` object with status changed to READY

**Status Codes**:
- 200 OK: Order marked as ready
- 400 Bad Request: Order not in PREPARING status
- 404 Not Found: Order not found
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required

### 4. Business Logic

#### Order Status Flow
1. **ON_HOLD**: Order held at POS terminal
2. **PREPARING**: Order transferred to kitchen (visible in Kitchen View)
3. **READY**: Order marked ready by kitchen (removed from Kitchen View)
4. **COMPLETED**: Order completed and paid

#### Validation Rules
- Only orders with `PREPARING` status can be marked as ready
- Kitchen View only shows orders in `PREPARING` status
- Feature is designed for outlets with `RESTAURANT_CAFE` mode
- Orders automatically disappear from Kitchen View when marked as ready

### 5. Data Model

#### KitchenOrderDTO Structure
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "orderNumber": "ORD-001",
  "orderType": "DINE_IN",
  "createdDate": "2025-10-17T09:30:00Z",
  "customerEmail": "john@example.com",
  "tableId": 2,
  "tableNumber": "Table 2",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "productName": "Margherita Pizza",
      "quantity": 1,
      "imageUrl": "https://example.com/pizza.jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Testing

#### Unit Tests Summary
- **Total Test Cases**: 8
- **Service Layer Tests**: 5
  - Get kitchen orders (success)
  - Get kitchen orders (empty result)
  - Mark order as ready (success)
  - Mark order as ready (invalid status error)
  - Mark order as ready (not found error)
  
- **Controller Layer Tests**: 3
  - Get kitchen orders endpoint
  - Mark order as ready endpoint
  - Empty results handling

#### Test Coverage
- All new methods have comprehensive unit tests
- Both success and failure scenarios are covered
- Error handling is validated
- All tests pass successfully

### 7. Integration Points

#### Existing Features Used
- **Order Management**: Leverages existing `Order` entity and `OrderRepository`
- **Order Status**: Uses existing `OrderStatus` enum
- **Outlet Mode**: Respects `OutletMode.RESTAURANT_CAFE` designation
- **Product Images**: Uses existing `Product.imageUrl` field
- **Table Management**: Uses existing `DiningTable` entity

#### Frontend Integration Notes
- Kitchen View should poll or use WebSocket for real-time updates
- Product images should be displayed for visual identification
- Customer email helps identify online/takeaway orders
- Table number helps identify dine-in orders
- Orders should be sorted by creation date (oldest first)

### 8. Configuration

No additional configuration required. The feature uses existing:
- Database schema (Order, OrderItem, Product, DiningTable tables)
- Security configuration
- API response format (`ApiResponse<T>`)

### 9. Performance Considerations

- Queries filter by outlet ID and PREPARING status (indexed fields)
- Returns minimal data for kitchen display (not full order details)
- No pagination required (typically small number of orders in preparation)
- Product images should be served from CDN for optimal performance

### 10. Security

- All endpoints under `/api/admin/kitchen` require authentication
- Uses existing Spring Security configuration
- Authorization checks should be implemented at security layer

### 11. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future releases:
1. Real-time updates via WebSocket
2. Kitchen order prioritization
3. Estimated preparation time tracking
4. Kitchen station routing (e.g., hot kitchen, cold kitchen, drinks)
5. Order modifications from kitchen view
6. Sound/visual alerts for new orders
7. Multiple kitchen displays support

## Files Changed
