# Fix: Password Reset Redirect Loop Issue

## Problem Statement

After successfully resetting their password and logging in with the new credentials, users were being redirected back to the reset password screen (`/reset-password`) instead of the intended dashboard page.

### Console Output Showing the Issue
```
LoginPage redirecting to: /reset-password
```

This indicated that even though the user had successfully reset their password and `requirePasswordReset` was `false`, the `from` variable contained `/reset-password` as the redirect destination.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Flow That Caused the Issue

1. **User in ResetPasswordPage** (`/reset-password`)
   - User fills out password reset form
   - Calls `resetPassword()` API
   - Calls `logout()` to clear authentication
   - Navigates to `/login` with state: `{ passwordResetSuccess: true }`

2. **Potential Race Condition**
   - During logout, user is still on `/reset-password` route
   - ProtectedRoute wrapper detects `!isAuthenticated` 
   - ProtectedRoute redirects to `/login` with state: `{ from: { pathname: '/reset-password' } }`
   - This state can override or merge with the explicit navigation from ResetPasswordPage

3. **User Logs In**
   - Backend returns `requirePasswordReset: false` (password was just reset)
   - LoginPage's `from` variable is set from `location.state.from.pathname`
   - `from` contains `/reset-password` instead of the default `/admin/dashboard`
   - LoginPage navigates to `/reset-password` instead of dashboard
   - This creates a confusing user experience

## The Fix

### Changes Made to `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const from = (location.state as { from?: { pathname: string }; passwordResetSuccess?: boolean })?.from?.pathname || '/admin/dashboard';
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Filter out /reset-password from 'from' to avoid redirect loop after password reset
const fromPath = (location.state as { from?: { pathname: string }; passwordResetSuccess?: boolean })?.from?.pathname;
const from = (fromPath && fromPath !== '/reset-password') ? fromPath : '/admin/dashboard';
```

### Why This Works

1. **Extracts the pathname**: First, we get the `fromPath` from location state
2. **Filters invalid destinations**: We check if `fromPath` exists AND is not `/reset-password`
3. **Defaults to dashboard**: If either condition fails, we use `/admin/dashboard` as the destination

This ensures that:
- After password reset, users are redirected to the dashboard, not back to reset password page
- Protected routes that require authentication still work correctly (e.g., `/admin/orders` → login → `/admin/orders`)
- The fix is minimal and doesn't affect other navigation flows

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Normal Login (No Password Reset)
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid credentials for a user that does NOT require password reset
3. **Expected**: Redirected to dashboard
4. **Verify**: URL is `/admin/dashboard`

### Test Case 2: First-Time Login (Requires Password Reset)
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter credentials for a user that requires password reset (e.g., default admin)
3. **Expected**: Redirected to reset password page
4. **Verify**: URL is `/reset-password`

### Test Case 3: Password Reset Flow (THE FIX)
1. Complete test case 2 to be on the reset password page
2. Fill out the password reset form with valid data:
   - Current password
   - New password (at least 4 characters, different from current)
   - Confirm new password (matching new password)
3. Submit the form
4. **Expected**: Logged out and redirected to login page with success message
5. **Verify**: Green success banner appears with message "Password reset successful! Please login with your new password."
6. Enter username and NEW password
7. Click "Sign In"
8. **Expected**: Redirected to DASHBOARD, not reset password page
9. **Verify**: 
   - URL is `/admin/dashboard`
   - NOT redirected back to `/reset-password`
   - Can navigate to other protected routes successfully

### Test Case 4: Access Protected Route While Not Authenticated
1. Ensure you're logged out
2. Navigate directly to `/admin/orders` in browser address bar
3. **Expected**: Redirected to login page
4. **Verify**: After logging in, redirected to `/admin/orders` (the originally requested page)

### Test Case 5: Already Authenticated User Visits Login
1. Log in successfully
2. Manually navigate to `/login` in browser address bar
3. **Expected**: Automatically redirected to dashboard (since already authenticated)

## Impact

- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact
- ✅ **Minimal Code Change**: Only 2 lines modified in one file
- ✅ **Surgical Fix**: Addresses the specific issue without affecting other flows
- ✅ **Lint Passes**: No ESLint warnings or errors
- ✅ **Build Passes**: TypeScript compilation succeeds
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users are no longer confused by unexpected redirects

## Files Changed

1. `src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` - Added filter to prevent `/reset-password` from being used as redirect destination

## Related Issues

This fix addresses the redirect loop that occurred specifically in the password reset flow. It complements the existing fixes for:
- Race condition handling with `isNavigating` flag
- SessionStorage fallback in ProtectedRoute
- Proper `requirePasswordReset` boolean conversion

## Summary

The fix is a simple, defensive programming approach: we explicitly filter out `/reset-password` from being used as a redirect destination after login. This ensures that users who have just completed the password reset flow are directed to the dashboard, not back to the page they just came from.
