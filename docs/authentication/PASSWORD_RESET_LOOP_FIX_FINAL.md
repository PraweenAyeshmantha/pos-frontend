# Password Reset Loop - Final Fix

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing a redirect loop after resetting their password and logging in again. Despite `requirePasswordReset` being correctly set to `false` in both the backend response and sessionStorage, users were continuously redirected to the password reset page when trying to access protected routes like the dashboard.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by a **React state update race condition** during the login flow:

1. User logs in after password reset
2. `authService.login()` immediately stores correct user data in sessionStorage (with `requirePasswordReset: false`)
3. `AuthContext.login()` updates React state asynchronously via `setAuthState()`
4. LoginPage's `handleSubmit` navigates to dashboard immediately after login
5. Dashboard route renders and `ProtectedRoute` component executes
6. `ProtectedRoute` reads `user.requirePasswordReset` from auth context state
7. **Problem**: React state update is asynchronous and may not have completed yet
8. If `ProtectedRoute` reads stale state (with `requirePasswordReset: true`), it redirects back to `/reset-password`
9. This creates a redirect loop

### Why Manual URL Entry Worked

When users manually typed the dashboard URL:
- The page was already fully rendered
- React state had time to update completely
- No race condition occurred
- `ProtectedRoute` saw the correct `requirePasswordReset: false` value

## Solution

### 1. Prevent LoginPage useEffect Interference

Added an `isNavigating` flag to prevent the LoginPage's useEffect from triggering a second navigation after `handleSubmit` has already navigated:

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && user) {
    if (user.requirePasswordReset) {
      navigate('/reset-password', { replace: true });
    } else {
      navigate(from, { replace: true });
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user, navigate, from]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [isNavigating, setIsNavigating] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && user && !isNavigating) {
    if (user.requirePasswordReset) {
      navigate('/reset-password', { replace: true });
    } else {
      navigate(from, { replace: true });
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user, navigate, from, isNavigating]);

// In handleSubmit, before navigation:
setIsNavigating(true);
```

### 2. Read Fresh Data in ProtectedRoute

Modified `ProtectedRoute` to read from sessionStorage as a fallback, ensuring it always has the most recent `requirePasswordReset` value even if React state hasn't updated yet:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only reads from React state (may be stale)
if (user?.requirePasswordReset && location.pathname !== '/reset-password') {
  return <Navigate to="/reset-password" replace />;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Read from React state first
let requirePasswordReset = user?.requirePasswordReset || false;

// Double-check with sessionStorage to get the most recent value
const userStr = sessionStorage.getItem('user');
if (userStr) {
  try {
    const sessionUser = JSON.parse(userStr);
    requirePasswordReset = sessionUser.requirePasswordReset === true;
  } catch {
    // If parsing fails, use the context value
    requirePasswordReset = user?.requirePasswordReset || false;
  }
}

if (requirePasswordReset && location.pathname !== '/reset-password') {
  return <Navigate to="/reset-password" replace />;
}
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Eliminates Race Condition**: By reading from sessionStorage (which is updated synchronously during login), `ProtectedRoute` always has access to the latest user data, even if React state hasn't updated yet.

2. **Prevents Double Navigation**: The `isNavigating` flag ensures that LoginPage's useEffect doesn't interfere with the navigation initiated by `handleSubmit`.

3. **Consistent Data Source**: Both `authService.login()` and `ProtectedRoute` now rely on sessionStorage as the source of truth for immediate checks, while still maintaining React state for reactive UI updates.

4. **Backward Compatible**: The fix gracefully falls back to React state if sessionStorage read fails, ensuring the app continues to work correctly.

## Files Modified

1. **src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx**
   - Added `isNavigating` state
   - Updated useEffect to check `!isNavigating` before navigating
   - Set `isNavigating = true` in handleSubmit before navigation

2. **src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx**
   - Added sessionStorage read to get fresh `requirePasswordReset` value
   - Use sessionStorage value when available, fallback to React state
   - Added try-catch for safe JSON parsing

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: First-Time Login (Password Reset Required)

1. Login with credentials that require password reset (e.g., default admin account)
2. **Expected**: Redirected to password reset page
3. **Verify**: No redirect loop, stays on password reset page

### Test Case 2: Password Reset Flow

1. Complete the password reset form with valid passwords
2. **Expected**: Logged out and redirected to login page with success message
3. **Verify**: sessionStorage is cleared

### Test Case 3: Login After Password Reset (Main Fix)

1. Login with the NEW password
2. **Expected**: Redirected to dashboard immediately
3. **Verify**: 
   - No redirect to password reset page
   - No redirect loop
   - Dashboard loads successfully
   - Can navigate to other protected routes

### Test Case 4: Direct URL Access

1. After successful login, manually type dashboard URL in address bar
2. **Expected**: Dashboard loads successfully
3. **Verify**: No redirect to password reset page

### Test Case 5: Already Authenticated User

1. While logged in (without password reset needed), navigate to `/login`
2. **Expected**: Redirected to dashboard automatically
3. **Verify**: No redirect loop

### Test Case 6: Session Persistence

1. Login successfully
2. Refresh the page
3. **Expected**: User remains logged in, dashboard loads
4. **Verify**: No redirect to password reset page

## Verification

- ✅ Linter passes (no ESLint errors)
- ✅ Build passes (no TypeScript errors)
- ✅ Logic verified through code review
- ✅ Race condition eliminated by reading from sessionStorage
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing functionality

## Impact

- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact
- **No Backend Changes**: Uses existing API contract
- **Improved Reliability**: Eliminates race condition that caused the loop
- **Better User Experience**: Smooth, seamless login flow without confusing redirects
